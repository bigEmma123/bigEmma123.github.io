 So this should print 12345, but it actually prints 00000. I cannot figure out why.

#include <isotream>
#include <vector>

vector<int> suitors(10);

    for(int i = 0; i < 5; ++i)
    {
        suitors.push_back(i + 1);
    }

    for(int i = 0; i < 5; ++i)
    {
        cout << suitors.at(i);
    }

In line 4 you create a vector with 10 members, then you add five more.

Try changing line 11 to:

for (int i = 0; i < 15; i++)

and you'll see what I mean.

Remove (10) after suitors declaration.
